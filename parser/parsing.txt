reading the go source file most efficiently. but create managable code.

read it only once.
read the line.
detect if it contains data we want. 
- starts with func
- starts with var
- starts with type

toss scanner into handler that will handle extract the info it wants.
and returns the scanner.

use splitfunc? or just scanlines?
all information we want is always at the start of a line.

the different handlers store a list of matches.
